		<p>Way back in 1994, I did a school year aboad in Italy.  I was at the <a class="myLinks" href= "http://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank">Rhode Island School of Design</a>and I had the chance, through RISD, to study art for a year in Rome.  It was expensive and I had to save up money to do it, but I was able to go and loved being in Rome.</p>

		<p>In the fall it is warm in Rome, so I used to go out to the piazzas.   I would sit and draw, but I would also sometimes take my guitar.  One great thing about art school is that practically everyone plays guitar.</p>

		<p>So I had a couple of school mates who also played to. We started going out to the piazzas to play.  We used to go to a smaller, more quiet piazza in an area called Trastevere and play and there was a fountain there to sit and play while the people went from store to store and on to a shopping are past the piazza</p>

		<p>When we were packing up and going home, one night we got the idea to walk a bit in the other direction.  We walked for a while and we got a little lost, further in Trastevere.</p>


		<p>We stopped at a restaurant-bar establishment. We were kind of lost and just wanted to get a good heading so we could get back home.  The proprietor, Leo,looked at us and saw we had guitars.  "Sounare au Guitar" He. asked.  We didn't really understand.  We thought we was giving us directions, but it turned out he was asking if we played guitar and wanted to maybe play at his place.</p>


		<p>Ateleo was a great place.  We played every Saturday night there for most of the fall and winter and spring.  Evenings were great because the staff assembled before the place opened and everyone helped to make a dinner that was shared.  That was really the nicest thing of all from playing.  We also met a lot of people through Ateleo.  We really didnt get paid much, but the experience was amazing!</p>
